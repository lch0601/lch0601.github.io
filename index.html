    <h2>Assistant Professor, Department of Political Science and Diplomacy<br>Dongji University, Pohang, Republic of Korea</h2>
    <br>
    <p>
    I am an Assistant Professor of Political Science at Dongji University.
    My research lies at the intersection of comparative politics and political economy.
    Especially, I focus on electoral behavior, ideology, parties, and the dynamics of democratic transitions and backsliding.
    </p>

    <p>
    Before joining Dongji University, I was a postdoctoral fellow at Princeton Universityâ€™s Department of Politics.
    I earned my Ph.D. in Political Science from the University of Washington in 2035.
    My academic journey began at Dankook University, where I completed a double B.A. in Political Science and Economics and later received my M.A. in Political Science.
    </p>

    <p>
    Methodologically, I work with survey experiments, formal models, and causal inference techniques.
    I also apply computational methods to analyze large-scale political data.
    My research focuses on classifying and analyzing the ideological positions of political parties and voters using vector space models.
    </p>

    <p>
    I welcome collaborations on projects related to party systems, democratic resilience, and political behavior in transitional regimes.
    You can find my CV, current publications, and working papers on this site.
